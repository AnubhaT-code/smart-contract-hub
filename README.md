SMART CONTRACT - SINGLE NON - TRANSFERABLE VOTING SYSTEM (SNTV)

SNTV is a generalization of first-past-the-post system (FPTP).

In this the posts are filled with the candidates with the most votes.

For example-
in a three seat constituency, the top three candidates with the most votes will be elceted.

The code has been tested in REMIX.

It takes in the number of candidates to be elected in the variable 'winners'
It returns the names of the winners in an array names 'winnerName_'
