BINOMIAL ELECTION SYSTEM

In the Binomial System, two candidates are elected per electoral bloc.
1. Each party sends two candidates
2. Each voter votes for the party and candidate of his/her choice.
3. The votes of the winning and the next winning party are calculated.
4. If the number of votes won by the winning party are greater than or equal to double the votes of the next party, both the candidates of the winning party are elected.
5. Else, the candidate with the most votes in the winning and the next winning party are elected.
